	description = A magnificent tank, very tall, very strong, very red. People love the red, they say it’s the best color for a rocket, and they’re right. Built by the best engineers anywhere in the world. Western tanks? Nice tries, but honestly, they’re not even close. This tank comes down like a dragon. Very impressive. Very reusable. Everyone’s talking about it.
