	description = It’s minimal, it’s open, it’s truss-y. It's so incredibly lightweight, people say it’s practically not even there, which is true, but in a good way. It holds your upper-stage engine with perfect confidence. No nonsense, no extra weight, just pure, elite structure. A very classy skeleton of metal.
