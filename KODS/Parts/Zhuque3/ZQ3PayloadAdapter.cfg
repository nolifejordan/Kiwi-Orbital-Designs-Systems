	description = This payload adapter makes sure your spacecraft stays in one piece, which is very important, folks. Very important. Perfectly assembled, unbelievably dependable. Other adapters fall apart, they wobble. This one? Solid. Beautifully solid. It sends your payload off like a champion, and it does it every single time. They ask if we have payloads then I'll say we have concepts of a payload. Many concepts.
