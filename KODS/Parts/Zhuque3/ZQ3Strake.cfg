	description = Everybody says it’s not a wing. But believe me, it’s basically a wing, and a fantastic one. Our metalworkers did such an unbelievable job, people can’t even believe it. It gives the booster the most beautiful lift, the most graceful landings, nobody’s ever seen anything like it. Truly world-class.
