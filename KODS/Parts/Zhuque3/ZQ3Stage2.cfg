	description = It’s stubby, okay? I’ll say it. But it’s the best stubby tank you’ll ever see. Cheap, efficient, nobody builds tanks like this, nobody. The workers did an incredible job, really fantastic. It punches way above its weight. Some say it’s the most effective small tank ever built. I’m not saying that, but people are saying it.
